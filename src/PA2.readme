I have set up the driver class to initialize a hashTable of size 1000,
and inserts hashElements with keys of random strings (5-15 letters long)
and values of 1. The distribution seems to work well; when 1000 elements
are inserted, it seems that the most collisions that might occur will
be around 5, and generally less than that. With 10,000 elements, there are
very few 0's, and the most collisions in any one tree is around 20, while
most have around 5-10. For various sizes of the table and number of inputs,
the table always looks reasonably distributed, for both prime and non-
prime numbers.
